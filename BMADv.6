# 📄 BMAD v.6: MegaPulse - High-Frequency Prediction Market
**Project Type:** DeFi / Micro-Betting
**Network:** MegaETH Timothy Testnet (Chain ID: 6343)
**Objective:** Create a fast-paced "15-Second Bitcoin Price Prediction" game to demonstrate MegaETH's real-time settlement capabilities.

## 1. System Architecture
The system consists of a smart contract acting as the betting pool and a frontend that simulates a price oracle for the MVP demo.

### 1.1 Tech Stack
* **Blockchain:** MegaETH Timothy Testnet
    * **RPC:** `https://timothy.megaeth.com/rpc`
    * **Chain ID:** `6343` (Hex: `0x18C7`)
    * **Currency:** ETH
    * **Gas Note:** Must hardcode gas limit to `30,000,000` for transactions to pass on Timothy.
* **Smart Contract:** Solidity ^0.8.18 (Lock funds, accept bets, payout winners).
* **Frontend:** HTML5 + Ethers.js v5.7.2 + Lightweight Charts (for BTC price visualization).

### 1.2 Core Logic (Round-Based)
1.  **Start Round:** The contract opens a round for 15 seconds. Current BTC price is recorded (Mock Price).
2.  **Betting:** Users bet ETH on whether the price will go **UP** or **DOWN**.
3.  **Resolution:** After 15 seconds, the "End Price" is submitted.
    * If End > Start: UP bettors win.
    * If End < Start: DOWN bettors win.
    * Winners share the loser's pool (minus a small fee).
    * **MegaETH Advantage:** Payouts happen *instantly* in the same block as resolution.

## 2. Smart Contract Requirements (MockOracle Approach)
Since this is a testnet without Chainlink:
* Create a function `resolveRound(int256 endPrice)` that can be called by the owner (or the frontend for the demo) to close the round and distribute funds.
* Use `mapping(uint256 => Round)` to store round history.

## 3. Frontend Requirements
* **Real-time Chart:** Fetch mock BTC price or real API price every second.
* **Countdown Timer:** Visual circle counting down 15 seconds.
* **Interaction:** "Bet UP" (Green) and "Bet DOWN" (Red) buttons.
* **Visuals:** Cyberpunk/Neon aesthetic suitable for a fast crypto game.

## 4. Business Value
Demonstrates that MegaETH can handle:
1.  High-frequency state changes (Rounds opening/closing every 15s).
2.  Immediate liquidity settlement (No waiting for withdrawal periods).
